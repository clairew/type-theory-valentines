# Type Theory Valentines

![card](cards/type_inference.png)

## Valentines

1. "Let's form a product type together - I'll be fst if you'll be snd"
2. "Are you a dependent type? Because my heart depends on you"
3. "Like type inference, I knew you were my type from the start"
4. "You're the pattern match I've been waiting for"
5. "You're the type annotation that makes my life well-defined"
6. "Our love is strongly normalizing - every path leads to you"
